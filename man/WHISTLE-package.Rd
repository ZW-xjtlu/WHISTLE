\title{WHISTLE package for the annotation of hand-crafted transcriptomic features used in the prediction of epitranscriptomic modifications.}
\description{
\bold{WHISTLE} is an R package for annotating hand-crafted transcriptomic features that are powerful in the machine learning prediction of the epitranscriptomics markers.
The package provides the computational representation of the known topological and functional genomic features related to the mRNA modifications.
Users are required to provide the range based site information in \code{\link{GRanges}} format.
Then, WhisleR will automatically retrieve transcriptomic features from the corresponding databases to return a summarized feature matrix.
In addition, the feature set annotated can be expanded and tailored on the specific application domain according to user's requirement.

For specific example of the package usage, see the package vignette, by typing \code{browseVignettes("WHISTLE")}.

The package is still under active development, and we welcome all biologists and bioinformaticians for all kinds of communications and collaborations. Please feel free to contact Dr. Zhen Wei <zhen.wei@xjtlu.edu.cn> if you have any questions.
